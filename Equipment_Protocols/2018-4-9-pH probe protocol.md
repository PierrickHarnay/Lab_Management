- [**Setup**](#Setup) 
- [**Calibration**](#Calibration) 


1. <a name="Setup"></a> **Setup**
	1. Turn instrument on --> button shared between on/off and brightness
	2. When measurement screen appears, press f3 (setup)
	3. Select “channel” by pressing f3 (select)
	4. Select “mode & settings” by pressing f3 (select)
	5. Measure mode, read type, resolution, buffer grove, and calibration due alarm can all be set from this screen
	6. Press f1 to go back to measurement screen
	
	

2. <a name="Calibration"></a> **Calibration**
	1. Turn instrument on
	2. When measurement screen appears, press f1 (calibrate)
	3. Remove the electrode from the potassium chloride vial, and rinse in freshwater; do not touch the glass bulb
	4. Place electrode into first of three buffers; pH of 4
	5. Place temperature probe into buffer solution to ensure it is exactly at 25 degrees C. If the buffer is too cold, warm by grasping the buffer tube with your hands
	6. Once temperature is at 25 degrees C, Press f3 (start) to begin; make sure to gently swirl the probe while taking the reading
	7. Once the pH value has stopped changing for more than 10 seconds, press f2 (accept)
	8. Rinse electrode in freshwater; do not touch the glass bulb
	9. Press f2 (next) to add the second buffer and place electrode into the next buffer; pH of 7
	10. Place temperature probe into buffer solution to ensure it is exactly at 25 degrees C. If the buffer is too cold, warm by grasping the buffer tube with your hands
	11. Once temperature is at 25 degrees C, Press f3 (start) to begin; make sure to gently swirl the probe while taking the reading
	12. Once the pH value has stopped changing for more than 10 seconds, press f2 (accept)
	13. Rinse electrode in freshwater; do not touch the glass bulb
	14. Press f2 (next) to add the second buffer and place electrode into the last buffer; pH of 10
	15. Place temperature probe into buffer solution to ensure it is exactly at 25 degrees C. If the buffer is too cold, warm by grasping the buffer tube with your hands.
	16. Once temperature is at 25 degrees C, Press f3 (start) to begin; make sure to gently swirl the probe while taking the reading
	17. Once the pH value has stopped changing for more than 10 seconds, press f2 (accept)
	18. Rinse electrode in freshwater; do not touch the glass bulb
	19. Press f3 (cal done) to finish calibration process
	20. Press f1 to return to measurement screen
	21. With calibrated pH probe, measure desired solution; the measured value will be displayed on the measurement screen / wait until measurement stops fluctuating for 10 seconds
	22. Rinse electrode in freshwater; do not touch the glass bulb
	23. Place probe back into vial with potassium chloride solution
