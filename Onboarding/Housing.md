# Graduate Student Housing

### Most popular places for graduate students to live

![]()

Providence:  
- ~30-40 minutes away

Newport:  
- ~20-30 minutes away

Narragansett / Bonnet Shores:  
- ~10-20 minutes away

Other areas (less common but worth taking a look): Kingston, Wakefield, Peacedale, Wickford, Exeter, North Kingston.

Providence has more city vibes, Newport is more of a marina/wharf sailing town, Narragansett is a quiet beach town. So just depends on what you're looking for! And if you want to be with other grad students, need/want a smaller commute, etc.

### Lease options

There's 2 common types of leases here: academic and year-long (12 months). Academic is ~9 months beginning September and ends in May (for the school year). The academic rentals are usually fully furnished because they are someone's beach home that they rent out or live in for the summer but rent out to students during the year. Academic rentals are really just clustered near URI and in Narragansett with some in Charlestown.

- [Ann OBrien Realty](http://www.annobrienrealty.com/)    
- Craigslist does have some good options  
- URI graduate student housing facebook group can be helpful  
- URI has on-campus graduate student housing that is really cheap   

For the real estate companies, they are free to use as a renter so if you shoot them an email with what you're looking for they can be really helpful. I would not recommend Durkin Cottages Realty (nightmare as a renter, they are all about the $$).

### Rent

Average rent is somewhere between $600-$800 depending on what size house/apartment and where it is. Newport and Providence tend to be a bit more expensive than Narragansett and Bonnet Shores.
