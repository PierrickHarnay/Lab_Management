## Ph.D. Track

**Every** spring semester: [Annual Report](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Onboarding/CELS_Annual_Report_Form.pdf) due. This is an individual PDF found on the link above and not on airslate yet. After filling out form (make sure to complete all sections and sign), send it to Hollie for approval and her signatgure, then you will need to send it to the current EMB coordinator for another signature, finally you will send the completed document to Linda Murray | linda_murray@uri.edu. 

### Pre-Exams (Year 1-2)

There are no forms needed to schedule Qualifying or Comprehensive Exams anymore.

- "[Establishment of a Committee](https://uri.airslate.com/dm/edit/D045884B-2200-0000-0000BA29/9F09D63B-A800-0000-0000C9C1/E0F9859D-3310-0000-000021F6?embedded=false&flowId=D045884B-2200-0000-0000BA29&linkAsync=true&role_order=1&tracing_headerValue=0688257064685449%3A1320577525011801%3A0%3A1&tracing_name=openPublicLink&tracing_startTime=1631118160290000&xRequestId=53aac1cd9bfb431c49d6fb366108621e)" on airslate. You will likely start with 3 committee members and add a fourth member after written comprehensive to start for oral comprehensive exams.

### Post-Qualifying Exams (Year ~2-3)

- "[Program of Study](https://uri.airslate.com/dm/edit/6D0DFDE7-5100-0000-0000BA29/CF62473B-A800-0000-0000C9C1/7AD6769D-3310-0000-000021F6?embedded=false&flowId=6D0DFDE7-5100-0000-0000BA29&linkAsync=true&role_order=1&tracing_headerValue=5360268233925061%3A8687893474725479%3A0%3A1&tracing_name=openPublicLink&tracing_startTime=1631118192612000&xRequestId=07aac68103597dca7a9b429efe7dac10)" on airslate. I would recommend completing this form when all classes and credit requirements are done. Otherwise you will have to keep submitting updated copies of this.     
- I had to submit a successful completion of qualifying exam form but I no longer see this on the airslate forms page. Check with the graduate school to double check this requirement.

### Post-Comprehensive Exams (Year ~3)

Once you've completed comprehensive exams, complete the following:  
- "[Dissertation Proposal Approval Form](https://web.uri.edu/graduate-school/files/dissertation_approval_form.pdf)" on airslate. Science ethics training needs to be completed prior to filling out this form. Email this completed form and a PDF copy of your dissertation proposal to gradforms@etal.uri.edu. There is no need to turn in hard copies anymore. The dean of the graduate school then reads and approves all proposals.  
- I had to submit a successful completion of comprehensive exam form but I no longer see this on the airslate forms page. Check with the graduate school to double check this requirement.  

You will not be able to start the ABD process until the above forms are completed.

### 'All But Dissertation' Status (Year ~4-5)

- "[All But Dissertation Status Agreement (ABD)](https://uri.airslate.com/dm/edit/0008DC45-5100-0000-0000BA29/F77DE83B-A800-0000-0000C9C1/4DD1CA9D-3310-0000-000021F6?embedded=false&flowId=0008DC45-5100-0000-0000BA29&linkAsync=true&role_order=1&tracing_headerValue=2079153171771688%3A5567845150676400%3A0%3A1&tracing_name=openPublicLink&tracing_startTime=1631118244002000&xRequestId=7bb3c81662f565e45bb919b4b79a3fd6)" on airslate  
- Enroll in only 3 credits of BES699 with Hollie.
