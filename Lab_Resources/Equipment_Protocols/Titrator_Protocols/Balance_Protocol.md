1. **Setting up the Balance**
	1. Turn on Analytical Balance by holding the button

2. **Measuring with the Balance**
	1. Using an empty 80 ml Cup place the cup in the balance and wait until the weight stabilizes 
		1. Slide open the glass on either side of the balance.
	2. Press “→T←” to “Zero” the balance.
	3. Fill 60g of seawater
		1. (Optional: For beginners, it’s recommended to use a 100mL beaker or graduated cylinder to gain knowledge of the approximation of the cup) 
	4. Place the liquid filled cup into the balance, to receive a measurement.
		1. Precision: ± 0.0001g 
        5. Record the measurement for weight of each specific sample in a notebook or Excel data sheet to transfer to the LabX program before starting your titration.

3. **Clean up**
	1. Clean off the balance and plate.
	5. Shut off the Balance by holding in the power button.
