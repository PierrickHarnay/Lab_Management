# Coral 96-well plate Lipid Assay

- This protocol was modified and based off [this protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-lipid-assay-for-96-well-plates-bvcfn2tn)
- This protocol has been tested on coral homogenates that have been airbrushed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution, homogenized. Additionally, the symbiont cells have been removed via centrifugation.
- This protocol is also designed to work in 96 well plates

### Reagent and standard preparation
--------------------------

**0.05 M NaCl:**
- In a 50 mL labelled falcon tube,0.1461g NaCl in 50 mL DI water.

**Stock 1.5 mg/mL Corn Oil**
- In a 15 mL labelled falcon tube, add 245 μL of corn oil in 14.755 ml CHCl<sub>3</sub>
  - Calculations:
    - Density = 0.9188 g/ml (Noureddini et al., 1992)
    - Total volume of ampule = 1 g* (1ml / 0.9188g) =1.08837614 ml
    - Known concentration of ampule= 1000mg / 1.088ml = 918.8 mg/ml (same as known density)
    - Therefore:
      -  (1.5 mg/mL * 15mL) / 918mg/mL =  0.0245 mL (or 245 μL) of 918mg/mL Corn oil standard concentrate

**Stock 0.2 mg/mL vanillin in 17% phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>):**
- 20 mL of 17% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>   
  - In a labelled 50 mL Falcon tube, add 4 mL 85% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>  to 16 mL of DI water
- Stock vanillin solution  
  - In a labelled 50 mL Falcon tube, add 4 mg vanillin to 20 mL 17% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>

**Make subsets of the following reagents in labelled 50mL Falcon tubes daily**
- CHCl<sub>3</sub> (Chloroform)
- CH<sub>3</sub>OH (Methanol)
- Concentrated (18M) sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)

### Protocol
--------------------------

**Note before starting: All portions of this protocol should be performed in a fume hood as much as possible with appropriate safety precautions, including gloves, lab coat, and closed toe shoes.**


#### Lipid Extraction

1. Pull samples from -80 freezer and allow to thaw
  - Maximum of 24 samples per plate in triplicates
2. Add 400 μL of CHCl<sub>3</sub> and 200 μL of CH<sub>3</sub>OH in a 2:1 ratio to each labelled 1.5 mL sample tube
3. Vortex sample and transfer 600 μL of coral tissue slurry sample to the corresponding 1.5 mL tube
4. Vortex then shake on plate shaker for 20 minutes
  - *Prepare standards in the section below*
5. Add 160 μL of 0.05M NaCl
  - CHCl<sub>3</sub>:CH<sub>3</sub>OH:NaCl is in a 2:1:0.8 ratio – keep this ratio
6. Invert tubes gently two times and open and re-close lid
7. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes
8. Remove CHCl<sub>3</sub> (top) layer and dispose before taking 100 μL for the assay
  - Do three times for 3 replicates of 100 μL

#### Lipid Standard creation

1. Make a stock serial dilution in 7 1.5 mL tubes for each plate
2. Add 300 μL of CHCl<sub>3</sub> to standard tubes 2 through 7
3. Add 600 μL of 1.5 mg/ml stock to standard tube 1
4. Transfer 300 μL of tube 1 and place in tube 2. Pipette mix
5. Pull 300 μL from tube 2 and place in tube 3. Pipette mix
6. Repeat this process for tubes 3 through 6
 - Do not add corn oil to tube 7! This is the blank
7. Discard 300 μL from tube 6 so total volume equals 300 μL (optional)

|  Standard | Concentration (mg/mL) |
|:---------:|:---------------------:|
|     1     |          1.5          |
|     2     |          0.75         |
|     3     |         0.375         |
|     4     |         0.188         |
|     5     |         0.094         |
|     6     |         0.047         |
| 7 (Blank) |           0           |

#### Lipid Assay

1. In a 96-well plate, add 100 μL of sample or standard to each well in triplicates
2. Add 50 μL of CH<sub>3</sub>OH to each well
3. Evaporate solvent on a 90°C hotplate for 10 minutes
4. Add 100 μL H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to each well
  - Wells will change from clear to yellow colour
5. Incubate on hotplate at 90°C for 20 minutes
6. Cool the plate on ice for 2 minutes
7. Transfer 75 μL of each sample or standard from the microplate to a new 96-well microplate
  - Wells may contain sticky residue and bubbles, but you should be able to avoid that to pull the required 75 μL
8. Cover the plate and read background absorbance at 540 nm using microplate reader
  - This is a baseline measure that is used for correcting the final plate absorbance
9. Add 34.5 μL of 0.2 mg/mL vanillin in 17% phosphoric acid to each well
10. Incubate for 10 minutes
 - Should change from yellow to pink color
11. Cover the plate again and read absorbance at 540 nm using microplate reader


### Calculations
--------------------------

1. Create standard curve with known standard concentrations and absorbance values (y = mx + b)
2. Using the resulting equation, convert sample absorbance to concentrations (mg/mL)
3. Multiply sample concentration (mg/mL) by total slurry volume (mL) and dilution factor (600/1360 μL), then divide by surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>) for resulting units: mg/cm<sup>2</sup>
