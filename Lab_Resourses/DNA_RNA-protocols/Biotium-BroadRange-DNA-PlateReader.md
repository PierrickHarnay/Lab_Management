[AccuBlue® Broad Range dsDNA Quantitation Kit with DNA Standards](https://biotium.com/product/accublue-broad-range-dsdna-quantitation-kit-with-9-dna-standards/)

1. Take the buffer and standards out of the fridge at LEAST 30 min before use, it needs to get up to room temp, keep it in a drawer because the components are light sensitive. **It can be useful to aliquot out the amount of buffer you need in a 50mL conical cold, then keep in the drawer and the smaller volume will warm up quicker**
2. **Determine what standards are needed**, you may not need all of them. Standards that come with the kit:  
  - 0 ng/ul  
  - 2ng/ul
  - 6.25ng/ul
  - 12.5ng/ul
  - 25ng/ul
  - 50ng/ul  
  - 100ng/ul
  - 150ng/ul
  - 200ng/ul  
  If you are not expecting samples to be over 150ng/ul you can omit those from the standards you use. You have to use the 0ng/ul, and the more standards you use the more accurate your curve. If you have room you can also double up on standards. Make sure to include your planned standards in calculations for the working solution and plate layout planning
3. **Prepare working solution** (goes in each well of the plate):  
  - A full plate (96 wells) is: 20mL buffer, 200ul dye, 200ul enhancer in a 50mL conical  
  Vortex and spin down all reagents and add into the conical  
  Then vortex and spin down the conical, use the large centrifuge to spin the conical  
  Cover the conical with foil or keep in a drawer before use because the dye and enhancer are light sensitive
  - If you have a different number of samples you can calculate the amount of working reagent to make:  
  200ul buffer per sample + 2ul dye per sample + 2ul enhancer per sample plus error (also include each standard you’re going to do here as a sample)
5. **Plan** how your samples and standards are going to be laid out in the 96 well plate **before** you pipette anything
4. Use a **black 96-well microplate** For each well that is going to be used (the standards plus your samples), pipette 200ul of the working solution. _It is best to use a trough and a p200 multichannel_
6. Adde 10ul of the appropriate standard to its corresponding planned standard well(s)
7. Adde **2ul** of sample to the appropriate well (this is different then the accublue protocol, they want you to use 10ul!)
8. Cover the plate with foil (loose foil, not a sticky lid) to block light and incubate on the shaker for 10 minutes (this also helps mix the samples with the solution)
9. Turn on the computer and the plate reader and **wait** for it to start up: you know when it is ready because the little hatch has opened for the second time and stays open
10. Opened the Gen5 software and chose the **BiotiumBroadRangeDNA.prt** protocol
11. Click on the plate icon to set the plate layout
12. Set the positions of the standards where they are in the plate:  
  Select the standard from the left side dropdown list and click on the well in the virtual plate where it will be (the curser is a pipette!)  
  It will automatically switch to the next standard in the list so if you are replicating them or skipping one you have to select it again  
  If you don’t use all the options on the program for standards that is fine, click ok if the program gives you an “error”   
  **The standards are set as the number of ng added to each well, aka the 6.25ng/ul standard is set as 62.5 because that is how many ng were added in the 10ul. The standard curve is made by calculating the ng/well, you can then divide the output by 2 to get the ng/ul because you add 2ul of sample**
13. Set your samples where they are in your plate, some times you can drag horizontally to make it go quicker. **Make sure you know what SP1,SP2, SP etc are in how they pertain to your actual sample #s**
13. Any well that has nothing in it do not click anything leave it white
14. Once the bulb has warmed up place the black plate into the holder, remove foil, and press start/play button
15. It takes less than a minute to read, and once done click on statistics and graphs tags to look at the readings
16. To copy things to excel, you first have to open excel on the computer (for some reason if you don’t have the excel welcome window already open, the Gen5 software won’t let you copy to excel)
17. Press the little excel sheet button on anything in the Gen5 file that you want to copy  
  Ex. The graph of the curve, the table with the curve fitting details, and the table with the statistics. You chose from the dropdown menu about the table to say you want to see ng/well (this is what you want)  
  Each time you press the excel icon it will copy to an excel sheet. You can upload that to google drive or whatever is needed
19. **Make sure you do the final calculation of ng/well to ng/ul in excel or sheets or etc. The program will give you ng/well so you divide that number by 2 to get the ng/ul for each sample**
