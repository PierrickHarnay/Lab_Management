# General QSonica Protocol

We have the [Q800R3 Sonicator](https://www.sonicator.com/collections/sonicators/products/q800r-sonicator)

This is a general protocol for operating the sonicator, specifics of the tubes used and settings in the machine will need to be optimized for your specific application. Also feel free to look at the [manual](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/Q800R3_Instruction_Manual.pdf)

**Preparing**

1. Take carboy of Type II DI water out of the cold room
2. Open the center housing and lift the black lid from the clear cylinder cup. It is connected by a wire so just rest it on the side
3. Fill the clear cup with 1.5 liters of the cold water
4. Turn the chiller on (square box to the right of the center housing), it should be set to 4 degrees
5. Once all the tubes have filled with water and are circulating, turn the knob at the bottom of the center housing to the - side (left) and watch the plastic bladder behind the clear cup fill to 50%. Once full turn the knob back to off
6. Check that there is 1-2cm of water above the titanium horn (silver cylinder in the middle of the cup), if not, add more water
7. Turn on the power to the programing box (left of the center housing) with the **l** button
8. Press the DEGAS button, it will run for 10 minutes _no samples can be in the sonicator at this point_

**Sample Prep and Sonication**

9. Prepare samples in specific tubes for the QSonica, make sure that all volumes are the same and that the tubes are spun down before placing in the rack
10. Arrange tubes balanced in the appropriate tube rack by unscrewing the top wavy part of the rack first. Then remove the solid circular plastic from the rack with holes. Place tubes in the rack with holes, then place the solid plastic circle on top to steady tubes and make sure all tubes are pushed down and seated equally. Then rescrew on the top wavy section of the rack with the magnet
11. Make sure the chiller shows that the water is at 4 degrees C
12. Set the program: press timer to set the _time that the sample is sonicated_. For example, if you set it for 5 minutes, the program will run for 10 minutes if you set the pulse to 30 sec on 30 sec off. Press enter to save the entry
13. Press pulse to enter the time on and off for sonication. It is best to have it be the same time on and off, ex 30 and 30 seconds or 15 and 15 seconds. Sonication has to go in pulses. Press enter to save the entry
14. Set the amplitude for the intensity of the sonication. 25% is a good number for DNA. Press enter to save the entry
15. Insert the sample tube rack by putting the magnets together and replacing the lid to the clear cup
16. Match the water level in the cup to the level of sample using the water adjustment knob at the bottom of the central housing ( + and - )
17. Close the lid (sound proofing) and press start on the program
18. If the program is longer than 5 minutes you can pause it and spin down the tubes in the middle to bring the sample liquid back to the bottom of the tube

**IMPORTANT: Clean-up**

19. Take the white tub to use for draining water
20. Turn everything off on the sonicator
21. Disconnect the coolant supply tube from the end where it connects to the central housing. Attach the blue drain fitting (in the basket) to that end of the tube and let it drain into the tub
22. Turn the water adjustment knob to the + sign
23. Turn on the chiller and let it pump out the water. TURN OFF the chiller when the water coming out of the tube stops flowing. Not all the water in the cup will come out
24. Using the black circular wrench, unscrew the clear plastic filter housing in the back of the chiller and pour out the water. Leave open to dry
25. Take the drain tube off the hook and plug the blue end into where the coolant supply tube usually goes, a small amount of water will come out in that tube. Once that is out unplug it and hang up again
26. Take a towel and soak up the rest of the water in the cup
27. Leave everything open to evaporate overnight then put back together the next day
